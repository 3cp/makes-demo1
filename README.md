# demo1
"makes" skeleton demo, only contains folder "common".

```sh
npx makes makesjs/demo1
# or
npx makes makesjs/demo1 a_project_name
```

"common/" folder is the base skeleton folder no matter what skeleton features end user chose.

This demo did not provide any skeleton features.

"common/README.md" uses preprocess feature that echos project name.

When you do `npx makes makesjs/demo1` or `npx makes makesjs/demo1 a_project_name`, you will get a project folder with readme file.
